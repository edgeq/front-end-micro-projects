                    <p>Moved from consumer-friendly training and events to digital education intitiatives in one of the foremost natural history museums in the world. At the Field Museum I got to design learning experiences using digital tools eventually

                    <p>Realizing a rather large skills & knowledge gap of web-technologies, I jumped in head-first to learn the full stack. It was ambitious, but my goal was to learn what I needed and apply to my career. I was in for a lifelong lesson in

                    <p>I learned the basics of web development which only served to highlight the other technologies that I needed to learn. So I learned PHP and began learning the Drupal content management system (cms). In 2018 I was able to make my first
